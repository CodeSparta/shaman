// how to generate a deliverable bundle of the terraform scripts
== Generating An Install Bundle
To package these scripts for delivery to the install environment,
the following guidance is provided.

As the local user on an internet connected box, run the following:

[source, shell]
----
git clone https://repo1.dsop.io/dsop/redhat/platformone/ocp4x/terraform/fences $HOME/fences-terraform
tar -cvf fences-terraform.tar.gz $HOME/fences-terraform
----

The generated `fences-terraform.tar.gz` file may now be transfered to the environment from which you will perform the install.
