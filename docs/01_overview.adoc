== Fences Terraform Scipt Objectives

Terraform is used to create the following:

* Security-groups
* elb
* Registry-node
* control-plane

== Deployment Environment

The bastion box assumes it has an IAM role with the ability to create the ec2 instances, ELB and security groups.
If keys are being used the user will need to modify the `provider.tf` file to the following:

.provider.tf
[source,terraform]
----
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "my-access-key"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
  region  = var.aws_region
}
----

== Prereqs

* VPC has been configured.
* There are 3 Private subnets for AZ HA.
* IAM roles have been created.
* P1 and OCP bundle have been executed.
* Public/Private SSH keypair is available

Additionally, the values in the following table will need to be known for
configuring the variables file.
